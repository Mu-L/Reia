			"The main menu has a temporary logo finally. Programmer art, am I right? It gets the job done.",
			"Your mouse now gets eaten by the game when you're playing. It's okay. Just press escape and it'll spit it back out.",
			"There's an inventory system now! It can hold items. That's about it. Press I to see some wonderful programmer art. Some effort was actually put into this one."

			"The third-person camera has been improved. A lot. The old one looked great but.... blech. It sucked. It felt really weird.",
			"Guess what? The lighting was improved. Again. It's small this time but still an improvement.",
			"The main menu UI is improved and you can now change the volume from there.",
			"The FPS changes if you're looking at a UI or not. Pretty much, when you need high FPS you get high FPS. Otherwise, let's save some energy. Summers are hot enough anyways."
