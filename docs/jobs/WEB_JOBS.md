## Web Development

### Frontend

The website is made with SvelteKit. We do use Supabase for authentication and Turso for the user data. But right now we just need improvements made to the frontend.

### Blogs

For blogs, we're going to take an approach where posting will trigger a push to the website's GitHub repository and save the post in an MDsveX format. For security purposes, this should definitely be sanitized. This push will trigger a new build process that should take about 20-60 seconds. Comments on this page would be stored in a table. that links the slug to their comment.

## Writing

### Blogs
Could use some monthly blog updates about what we've all accomplished in Reia. As well as changelogs in a format that's good for non-techies.

### Press-Kit
When we have some more things to post, We'll work on the PressKit. We already have a nice design that'll inspire ours: <https://impress.games/press-kit/nurt-studios/kitchen-madness>. We was going to use ImpressKit to make a press kit. But we're going to make my own from scratch so we can be free of limitations. Also means we can collect some analytics like when people click it or download images from it. This way we can find out what needs improvements. This will still be in compliance with the GDPR. We do use Plausible for our analytics already so we're off to a good start!

### About Us
Should just talk about the core team's history and what we all do.

### Contribute
This page needs more thought and time to figure out how to make it look better... but it's supposed to talk about the various ways people can contribute to the project. GitHub, art, funding. We've already finalized the platform we want to use for funding; that's [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/reia) and Kickstarter.

### Story
It's probably time to start off the story. So we're going to write the start to it all and then we can start branching off and making intricate stories that link together.
