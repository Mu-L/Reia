# Reia Story

Reia takes a less common approach to the way the story can be played. In your traditional game, you'd play through the entire story and be stuck with your decisions forever. At least until you make a new character. Reia is a game that does things a bit differently.

## Replayability

You're still locked into your initial choice like normal. The difference here is you're also able to replay any quest from a specific point. This follows an idea that you're revisiting memories, with the added benefit that this is a magical world and you *can* play every outcome. Your first choice will always be how the story defaults when continuing. Replaying it will present you with two things, the ability to experience the world as it would have been, and a cosmetic version of whatever item or ability you *might* have received through that quest. All of the items you'd get would be the same when you compare their stats. But some may function or look differently. So one reward item or skill won't be more powerful than the other but instead it might look or feel more powerful.

## Shared Storylines

When playing with friends, you can join their story progress and play with them.

### **Scenario A: You completed the story already and all pre-requisites.**
> Perfect! Just replay the story like normal.

### **Scenario B: You've done all the pre-requisites but you don't have the story completed.**
> You will just need to catch up on that specific story. It'll tell the host that they're still leading the progress, but for the other party member they'll have to redo some of the story so they sync up.

### **Scenario C: You've done nothing.**
> That's okay. Scenario B still takes effect. You will have to sync up for the quest to play with them. But if the quest has a part in it that requires someone else to work with them to achieve a goal (there are quests like this for the online version), then the host will have to get a 3rd player to handle that. If the player's world has already reached the max players, that's okay. An additional slot will be allowed. But only 1 additional slot.
>
> In Scenario C, when the guest player finishes the quest, they will have it completed. But it won't count towards anything, even a pre-req for other quests, until the underlying requirements are fulfilled first.

###  **A more technical explanation.**

**Host** is 10% done with a quest.\
**Guest** joins and they're 0% done with the quest.\
**Host** is technically still 10% done, but they have to start the quest over because of the guest.

Now let's say the **Host** is 20% done.\
The **Guest** joins with 50% of the quest done. The guest can pick up from the 20% mark.\
The **Guest** is still 50% done, but they will start progressing the story once the host reaches their 50%.

As for quests requiring other people, the reason why you'd still need to find someone else is because sometimes quest requirements include items. And those items might not be available to the guest.

When a guest completes a quest, they're asked if they'd like to keep the current outcome as their main choice. Until they decide, this won't complete any requirements for other quests but they'll still get rewards. But the reward will appear as the cosmetic version until a finalizing choice is made.
