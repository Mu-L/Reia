## What's next?

> v1.1.0-alpha is almost here

Our first major public demo is coming soon! This will introduce multiplayer, our new saving system, a new map, and a reworked UI. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.playreia.com) or visit [our website](https://www.playreia.com/join) for updates and information.

Reia has gotten closer to launching some MMO servers. [Sustenet](https://github.com/Quaint-Studios/Sustenet), our custom built networking solution, helped with that a ton. We finally integrated it in Godot and were able to host a server! We're also using [Turso](https://turso.tech) to handle both online and offline databases so you're able to play completely offline! Here are some of the things we've done since our last big update.

**1. Main Menu & Audio Improvements**

    The main menu now features a looping music track and has received UI polish.

**2. Backend Improvements**

    We're now using an SQL solution (Turso) to save players. We have player stats, items, and session data are stored. This allows us to also let you play across multiple regions and also export your latest data offline. You can't re-upload your data to a server, because that enables cheating. But, you can still continue where you left off. This is just for someone that wants to still play without internet or wants to mod their game with their latest progress.

    There's a reason why this section is the longest! It has gotten the most work. So, no eye-candy quite yet.

**3. Multiplayer Implementation**

    Multiplayer functionality has made a lot of progress. You can now host or join sessions. We're working on making that seamless.

**4. Inventory & UI Overhaul**

    The inventory system has been refactored with a new backend. The UI has also been improved, with more improvements coming as well.

**5. Progression & Stats**

    Player stats have been refined, with new calculations for experience, gear grades, and progression caps. We're also experimenting with new stats like sailing, mining, exploring, and more. You'll be able to unlock skills and passives by leveling these stats.

**6. World & Map Expansions**

    We've improved the performance, enhanced minimap features, and we're almost ready to showcase our first map. We've posted some early pictures in [Discord](https://discord.playreia.com) as well. Lighting and ambiance have also been upgraded.
