# Contributing

If there's anything in the [Roadmap](/docs/ROADMAP.md) you want to work on then here's how you can help.

1. Create an issue specifically for that task.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Create a branch with the following format:
     - ❌ makosai
     - ❌ makosai/change-the-layout-of-buttons
     - ✔️ makosai/main-menu
     - ✔️ makosai/keybindings
     - ✔️ makosai/multiplayer
     - ✔️ makosai/art

    > **a.** Your username/the-root-focus where the root focus is something that you could build upon in the future.
    > 
    > **b.** You can add more art, you can improve the multiplayer, there will sometimes be more keybindings, and the main-menu may change over time.
    > 
    > **c.** It shouldn't be overly specific either.
3. Follow the existing commit patterns:
     - ❌ fix the attack state
     - ❌ Fixed the attack state
     - ❌ Fix the attack state (missing period)
     - ✔️ Fix the attack state.
     - ✔️ Update the Main Menu UI.
     - ✔️ Change the player speed.
     - ✔️ Read the player position on load.
     - ✔️ Remove the ability to walk.
  The length of the commit doesn't matter. Just don't go overboard. If it's a long commit the summarize it and then put the rest of the information in the description of the commit.
5. Create a pull-request and done!
